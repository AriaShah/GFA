# GFA
The greenfield analysis for the multi-DC location problem
This repository contains two different Genetic algorithm python code using DEAP package for the GFA for the multi-DC location problem.
"GFA-multiDC-manualDemands" File is a Genetic algorithm python code that ask the user to manually enter the number of customers, the number of DCs, X and Y coordinates of customers, and the demand of customers. It provides the best location of DCs. In this file, it's assumed that DCs can be located anywhere in the middle of customers, however, integer X and Y coordinates for DCs are selected.
"GFA-multiDC-excellDemands" File is a Genetic algorithm python code that the X and Y coordinates of customers, and the demand of customers as an input via an excell file. It provides the best location of DCs. In this file, it's assumed that DCs can be located anywhere in the middle of customers, however, integer X and Y coordinates for DCs are selected.
"GPA" is an excell file containing the X and Y coordinates and demands of customers.
